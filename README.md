trying to fix ahiga's shitty css and get rid of all of the racist shit, poor optimization, and bloat

I really, absolutely fucking hate this css. It's so broken that when i change or optimize one thing it all breaks. 
How does this css even work in the first place? I don't know, a miracle.
I just want my discord ui to look pretty ffs
